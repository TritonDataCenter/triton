# SmartDataCenter Reference

SmartDataCenter is a large and complex beast. Many of the components that make
up SDC (REST APIs, agents, the SmartOS platform, important libraries) have their
own reference documentation. This page links to those, with a brief description
of each. See also the [overview of SDC repositories](./repos.md).


## Services

By "Services" here, we mean SAPI services of type "vm". See [the *service*
section in the glossary](./glossary.md#service) for details.

## Agents

By "Agents" here, we mean all SDC agents as described by the [*agent* section in
the glossary](./glossary.md#agent). The "Where" column of this table indicates
where an instance of this agent is typically running: "vm" means in SDC core
VMs, "gz" means in the global zone of SDC servers (both the headnode and
compute nodes).
