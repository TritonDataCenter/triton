## Q: I already have SmartOS on my system; how do I upgrade to SDC?

A: SmartOS is designed as a standalone, single-node environment. There is no way
to upgrade a SmartOS node to an SDC headnode or compute node. Instead, create a
new SDC environment and provision new instances there. Once an SDC headnode is
setup, you may convert a SmartOS node to an SDC compute node by booting into
"noinstall" mode, destroying the storage pool, and attaching the system to the
SDC networks [as
documented](https://docs.joyent.com/private-cloud/install/compute-node-setup).  This
will destroy all existing instances and result in a new, empty SDC compute node
ready for provisioning.  Migration of instances from SmartOS to SDC compute
nodes and between SDC compute nodes may be possible using
[vmadm(1m)](http://smartos.org/man/1m/vmadm) and ZFS commands but is not a
supported product feature and is not recommended.

## Q: My compute node failed to setup; how can I find out what went wrong?

A: Find the IP of the compute node from the [Admin
UI](./glossary.md#adminui). Obtain the compute node root password by
running `/usbkey/scripts/mount-usb.sh && cat
/mnt/usbkey/private/root.password.*` on your headnode. Run `bunyan $(svcs
-L ur)` on the compute node and check
the output for errors. The relevant output will likely be at the tail.
