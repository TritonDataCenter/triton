vminfod - VM Information Daemon
===============================

This is intended to be a crash course/1000 foot view of vminfod, see the RFD
below or the vminfod source code itself for more in-depth information.

[RFD 39 VM Attribute Cache
(vminfod)](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/rfd/blob/master/rfd/0039/README.md)

What It Is
----------

At its core, `vminfod` is a daemon that provides read-only access to "VMs"
(zones, HVM, LX zones, etc.) on a given system over an HTTP interface available
to the global zone of a system on `127.0.0.1:9090`.  It is a cache for this
information, only reaching out to the system to gather new information when
modifications are made to the system/to a zone.

On a system with `vminfod`, read-only actions like `vmadm list`, `vmadm lookup`,
and `vmadm get` are thin wrappers around HTTP requests to the `vminfod` daemon.
Read-write actions such as `vmadm create`, `vmadm reboot`, `vmadm update`, etc.
by contrast, behave in their normal way by reaching out to the system
directly to make the changes requested (e.g.  `vmadm update <vm_uuid> quota=10`
does some checks and calls `zfs set quota=10g` on the zoneroot dataset).  In
addition to making the change however, these read-write actions now "block"
on `vminfod`, and wait for the changes to be reflected before returning to the
caller.

On top of this static interface for looking up VM information in `vminfod`,
there is a second streaming interface that can be used that emits an event
anytime an update is done on the system (whether the source of the change was
`vmadm` or not).  This works by long-polling the `/events` endpoint, which sends
newline-separate JSON objects each time a change is made to the system; for
example, when a VM is created, deleted, or one of its properties is modified.

How To Use It
-------------

You should not need to do anything special to reap the benefits of `vminfod`.
Using the `vmadm` tools and other higher level interfaces (triton, its
agents, etc.) will use `vminfod` under the hood.  The only exception to this is
if you are modifying `vmadm` itself, in which case you should be able to find
examples and comments throughout the source to help you out.
