# List the Triton Engineering Jira projects. This is defined as the set of
# Jira projects on which we want the bi-weekly engineering release versions.
# E.g., these ones:
#
#    $ jirash versions HEAD
#    ...
#    17529  2016-07-07 Super Stretch        released  archived
#    17591  2016-07-21 Tangent Man          released         -
#    17646  2016-08-04 Uncle Jumbo                 -         -

# When adding a new Jira project for eng the process is:
# - add it to jira
# - add it to the whitelist here
# - manually add the upcoming sprint versions (see ./addsprintversion.sh) to it
